Using visual tools for quick presentations is overkill, in my opinion.
If you give different presentations weekly, please try a text-based tool;
I promise you won't regret it.
There are many options.
In this short post, I will discuss Reveal.js because it is part of my toolchain.

Reveal.js is an open-source JavaScript library for creating presentations using HTML,
CSS, and JavaScript.

## Super quickstart

Most tutorials will tell you to clone reveal.js and go from there. Don't do that. That is insane. Use **Pandoc** instead.

### What is pandoc

Pandoc is an open-source command line tool for converting documents between various formats.
It supports conversion between over 20 different document processing languages.
Good luck: [https://pandoc.org/installing.html](https://pandoc.org/installing.html)

### Markdown Template

Here's a template to make things simpler.
Save it as `slides.md` so that the following command works out of the box.

```markdown
---
title: Your Title Here
subtitle: Your Subtitle Here
author: Your Name Here
date: Date Here
output:
  revealjs::revealjs_presentation:
    theme: night
---

# Introduction

- Introduction slide 1
- Introduction slide 2

---

# Conclusion

- Conclusion slide 1
- Conclusion slide 2
```

### Using Pandoc to convert from Markdown to Reveal.js

Run the command below to get the `index.html` with your presentation.

```bash
pandoc -t revealjs -s -o index.html slides.md -V revealjs-url=https://unpkg.com/reveal.js/
```
