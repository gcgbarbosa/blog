Reinstalling a system is usually boring and time-consuming.
Why not speed it up?

We can do it by keeping our Dot Files organzied and ready.

## Dot Files

But what are Dot Files?

Dot Files (we're calling them from now on “dotfiles”) are files on Unix-like systems whose names (usually) start with a period,
used to keep configurations.

Common examples include:

- `.bashrc` – settings for the Bash shell.
- `.zshrc` – settings for the Zsh shell.
- `.gitconfig` – personal Git configuration (username, email, aliases).

Why care? If we back them up, we can easily transfer our settings to a new machine.

Note that those can also be folders such as `.ssh`.

## Eget

Some softwares are distributed as releases on their github pages.
We can grab the one by one or use [eget](https://github.com/zyedidia/eget) to grab them for us.

Eget is a little program that goes to the github page, downloads the binary, and place them inside the bin folder of our system.

I use the following `eget.toml` configuration file:

```toml
[global]
target = "~/.local/bin"
upgrade_only = true
```

I keep an `eget.txt` file and install them one by one by running:

```sh
eget <git_user/repo_name>
```

I usually do this one by one. Why? I want to make sure the software I am installing is still relevant to me.

## Package Managers

Some other programs are only installed via package managers.

For those, I keep a `<package-manager.txt>` file, and then install them one by one.

Some example of package managers include:

- `apt` for Debian-based systems.
- `homebrew` for macOS
- `pacman` for Arch

## Symbolic Links

I keep a github repository with all my dotfiles inside.

I usually export the dots folder using:

```sh
export DOTS_PATH="${HOME}/repos/dots"
```

Then, I create symbolic links from the proper dotfile location to the ones inside the repository:

```sh
ln -s ${DOTS_PATH}/.bashrc ${HOME}
```

I also add symlinks one by one, for the same reason as before.

## Keep a README.md

This one is self-explanatory.
Help our future self out by keeping a `README.md` so that we know what we did.
