### What is TikZ?

TykZ is a LaTeX package used for creating professional-looking graphics in scientific documents.
LaTeX is a typesetting language used for producing high-quality technical and scientific documents,
and TykZ provides additional tools and features for producing graphics in these types of documents.

### How to use TikZ?

TikZ is a package inside Latex.
To use TikZ, you will need a machine with Latex installed and working.

One solution to get Latex working faster is Overleaf.
Overleaf is a collaborative,
cloud-based LaTeX editor and project management tool for creating,
editing, and publishing scientific and academic documents.

If you want to learn TykZ, overleaf has a great 5 part tutorial: [learn tykz](<https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/LaTeX_Graphics_using_TikZ%3A_A_Tutorial_for_Beginners_(Part_1)%E2%80%94Basic_Drawing>).

You can use the following latex template to get started with TykZ.

```latex
\documentclass[12pt]{article}

\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage[margin=1in]{geometry}

\title{
  My beautiful square
}

\author{George C. G. Barbosa}
\date{\today}

\usepackage{tikz}
\usetikzlibrary{
  shapes,
  arrows,
  arrows.meta,
  shapes.geometric,
  calc,
  positioning,
  backgrounds,
  decorations.pathreplacing,
  matrix,
  math
}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \resizebox{\columnwidth}{!}{
    \begin{tikzpicture}[]
      \draw (0,0) -- (4,0) -- (4,4) -- (0,4) -- (0,0);
    \end{tikzpicture}
  }
\caption{\footnotesize{El squaro}}\label{fig:tikz}
\end{figure}

\end{document}
```

The above source code will draw a square of 4x4 units.
