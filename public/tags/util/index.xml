The idea behind explainable AI was to develop systems that could explain their reasoning process. In theory, this should increase trust and transparency around AI.
However, I would argue that recent developments have killed off research into explainable AI as a path forward, at least for now. The core issue is the rise of large language models that operate as black boxes.</description></item><item><title>The case for custom ergonomic keyboards</title><link>https://example.org/blog/keyboard/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jul 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.org/blog/keyboard/</guid><description>If we do our jobs right (programmers), we spend 40 hours a week typing on this thing called keyboard. Some people love keyboards—a lot. I am one of them. I started with mechanical keyboards, and I must warn you that this is addictive.
Mechanical Keyboards A mechanical keyboard uses individual mechanical switches for each key instead of the rubber dome or membrane commonly used in most modern keyboards. Sometimes the mechanical switches provide tactile feedback and a distinct &amp;ldquo;click&amp;rdquo; sound when pressed.</description></item><item><title>Tykz for scientific drawing</title><link>https://example.org/blog/tykz/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.org/blog/tykz/</guid><description>The two images below have the same information.

To this?
Using tikz :)
What is TikZ? TykZ is a LaTeX package used for creating professional-looking graphics in scientific documents. LaTeX is a typesetting language used for producing high-quality technical and scientific documents, and TykZ provides additional tools and features for producing graphics in these types of documents.
The TykZ package offers a variety of tools for creating graphics, including the ability to create 3D graphics, plot data, and produce animations.</description></item><item><title>Taking notes &amp; good science</title><link>https://example.org/blog/taking-notes/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.org/blog/taking-notes/</guid><description>You can&amp;rsquo;t have good science without taking notes unless you remember what you had for lunch 58 days ago. Science is about forming consensus and being able to replicate experiments. How can you repeat what you don&amp;rsquo;t remember? Have I convinced you? No? Then leave. Don&amp;rsquo;t read the rest. Have you convinced yourself now? I hope so&amp;hellip; grrrrrrrrr
Googling brings up some good things about note-taking in general:
Cornell Method: Divide your notepaper into a main notetaking area, a cue column, and a summary section.</description></item><item><title>Reveal.js super quick</title><link>https://example.org/blog/reveal-js/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.org/blog/reveal-js/</guid><description>Using visual tools for quick presentations is overkill, in my opinion. If you give different presentations weekly, please try a text-based tool; I promise you won&amp;rsquo;t regret it. There are many options. In this short post, I will discuss Reveal.js because it is part of my toolchain.
Reveal.js is an open-source JavaScript library for creating presentations using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is designed to allow customizable and interactive presentations to be viewed in a web browser without additional software.</description></item></channel></rss>
